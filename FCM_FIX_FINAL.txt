# ⚡ YOU WERE RIGHT! FCM WORKS ON AWARDSPACE

## ✅ THE FIX:

I used **wrong OAuth2 endpoint**!

Your working project uses:
```php
'aud' => 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'  ✅
```

I was using:
```php
'aud' => $service_account['token_uri']  ❌
```

## 📤 UPLOAD 1 FILE:

**File**: `send_notification_WORKING.php`

**Upload as**: `send_notification.php`

Based on YOUR proven working implementation!
