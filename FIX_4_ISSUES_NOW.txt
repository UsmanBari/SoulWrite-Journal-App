# ⚡ QUICK FIX - 4 Issues

## YOUR PROBLEMS:
1. ❌ Can't see likes on own journal
2. ❌ No comment notifications in Alerts
3. ❌ Can only see 3 of 8 comments
4. ❌ No push notifications

## THE SOLUTION:

### 1️⃣ RE-UPLOAD add_comment.php (CRITICAL!)
**You uploaded the OLD version!**

The NEW version has:
- Error suppression at top
- Better logging
- Fixed notifications

**Upload**: `backend/add_comment.php`
**To**: `http://barisoulwrite.atwebpages.com/backend/`

---

### 2️⃣ UPLOAD test_notifications.php (NEW FILE)
This will help diagnose issues.

**Upload**: `backend/test_notifications.php`
**To**: `http://barisoulwrite.atwebpages.com/backend/`

Then visit:
```
http://barisoulwrite.atwebpages.com/backend/test_notifications.php
```

Look for ✅ symbols. Should say:
- ✅ FCM notification sent successfully!

---

### 3️⃣ VERIFY services_json.json

Visit in browser:
```
http://barisoulwrite.atwebpages.com/backend/services_json.json
```

Should show Firebase JSON (not 404).

---

### 4️⃣ REBUILD APP

```
Android Studio:
File → Sync Project
Build → Clean Project
Build → Rebuild Project
```

---

### 5️⃣ TEST

1. ✅ Open own journal → See like count
2. ✅ View all comments → Can scroll
3. ✅ Add comment → Appears in Alerts
4. ✅ Put app in background → Get push notification
